# versions -- a file containing information about versions for the launcher. The first word helps the launcher figure out whether to show it and what type of version
# it is. Letters that make up this word are:
# v: A stable version
# d: A deprecated version
# s: The latest stable version
# a: An alpha version that is not stable and only for debugging.
# b: A beta snapshot that is stable but not bug-checked and therefor still in development
#
# w: A version that is only available on Windows
# l: A version that is only available on Linux
# m: A version that is only available on macOS
#
# The rest of the line is the version name itself, and the URL where it can be found.
