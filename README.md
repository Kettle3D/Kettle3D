# Kettle3D
A 3D sandbox game I'm working on allowing you to design and construct skyscrapers.

# The Basis
Kettle3D is designed to allow you to construct the skyscraper of your dreams, then turn on options to calculate lateral and gravity loads. Later on I plan to add more features such as electricity, plumbing, internet and the ability to build a whole city.

# Where is Kettle3D at?
Although the game itself is in early stages of development, a Windows 10 64-bit installer and a OS X 32-bit/64-bit installer are available - this installs the 3D rendering engine and the launcher, which updates itself every time you use it.

# Installation Instructions

Go [here](https://kettle3d.github.io/Kettle3D#installation-instructions) to view the installation intructions.

## Note
Please note that Kettle3D's world generation system is very inefficient. I will eventually post the files for an empty world on GitHub, but at the moment I'm still finalising it.  
If it takes about half an hour for your computer to generate the world, your computer is fast. I'll try and fix this when I can.

# How did I make it?
Kettle3D is currently being re-programmed using C#. It is switching to Unity3D for the rendering engine.

# DISCLAIMER
Please note that while every effort has been put into this game to ensure that users get a good experience, Kettle3D will not accept any responsibility for buildings prototyped on this game and built without confirmation that building codes are met. While this game allows you to simulate gravity and lateral loads, they may not mimic reality and are purely for amusement. Basically, don't use this game as an architecture guide.
