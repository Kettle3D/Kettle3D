Kettle3D
========

A 3D sandbox construction game that allows you to build all that you desire!

News and Updates
----------------

### The Natural Blocks Update
We're working on an update that adds new materials to the game, such as Diorite, Sandstone etc.

### Upgrades to Unity 2020.1
We are now migrating the project from Unity 2019.3 to 2020.1. This means that if you would like to contribute to the project, please keep an eye out for this. This doesn't change the game at all, the only thing that'll change is the Unity project version you'll need.

### Mesh Rendering Update
We're making some changes to the way the game keeps track of all of it's blocks. This will improve speed and allow for more features in the game, such as a gravity emulator and storm simulators.
