# Kettle3D
A 3D sandbox game I'm working on allowing you to design and construct skyscrapers.

# The Basis
Kettle3D is designed to allow you to construct the skyscraper of your dreams, then turn on options to calculate lateral and gravity loads. Later on I plan to add more features such as electricity, plumbing, internet and the ability to build a whole city.

# Where is Kettle3D at?
Kettle3D is currently in the early stages of developement. I'm hoping to release it later this year.

# How do I get it?
I will be releasing new changes as I make them, and as of current writing there are no installers available.

# How did I make it?
Kettle3D was programmed using Batch, Python and Tcl. The 3D rendering engine uses Panda3D, OpenGL, OpenAL and C++.
