Contributing to Kettle3D

Thank you for helping make Kettle3D happen. It really means a lot to us. But there are a few things I'll need to go over with you before you submit that pull request.

- If this code is readable, please keep it that way. If it isn't, please don't make it worse.
- The large number of comments that are in our scripts are there for people who are new to using C#, and we're trying to help them understand what each line does. You, by all means, do not have to continue this standard if you don't want to. About a third(ish) of Game.cs is comments.
- When you submit a pull request (or issue), there are a few labels we've added. We did this for a reason. Our issues and pull requests are mainly sorted into these categories:
  * New blocks (we've had fifteen of these, and there's only seventeen blocks). These should have the **`block`** label.
  * Typos, bugs and suggestions for the website (we get a lot of these too; most of them submitted by me). These should have the **`website`** label.
