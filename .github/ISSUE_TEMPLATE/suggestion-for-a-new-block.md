I'd like to suggest a new block for Kettle3D.

Have you made a texture for the block? (Textures must be PNG images, 64 pixels square that are used to render the side of the block. Some examples of textures that have been made into blocks can be found here: https://github.com/Kettle3D/Kettle3D/tree/C%23/game/Assets/textures .

If yes, please upload them here: https://github.com/Kettle3D/Kettle3D/upload/C%23/game/Assets/textures .

If not, please give us a short description of what you'd like this block to look like:

Thank you for your suggestion. We'd like to do everything we can to make Kettle3D better. We should have your block added into the game within the next 2 weeks. If not, we'll add a comment here explaining why.
